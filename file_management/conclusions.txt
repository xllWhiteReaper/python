Based on the program's output logs, we can observe that different scenarios take varying amounts of time to execute. For instance, the first-fit scenario takes less time, but it doesn't consider possible fragmentation, which can worsen the situation later on. The worst-fit scenario creates fragmentation from the very first memory allocation. The best-fit scenario, on the other hand, did not have the best implementation since it only looked at the first possible allocation after not finding the most optimal location on the first try. This approach may result in suboptimal memory utilization since it doesn't consider all possible allocations. However, if the program continued to search for the optimal space, it could have taken much longer and slowed down the allocation procedure.

It's worth noting that Linux uses a dynamic memory allocation technique called "malloc," which allocates memory as needed and releases it when it's no longer required. This technique enables Linux to use memory more efficiently and prevent memory leaks. Moreover, Linux has a built-in "swap" mechanism that enables it to utilize part of the hard disk as virtual memory when the physical memory is full. This ensures that the system can continue to operate even when the physical memory is depleted. As a result, Linux systems are generally more stable and less prone to crashes resulting from memory issues.

On the other hand, Windows uses a different memory allocation technique called "VirtualAlloc," which also allocates memory as needed but doesn't release it until the program explicitly requests it. This technique can lead to memory leaks if the program doesn't release the memory correctly. Additionally, Windows doesn't have a built-in swap mechanism but instead relies on a paging file on the hard disk to provide virtual memory. This can result in slower performance when the system needs to access virtual memory, primarily if the paging file is heavily utilized.

Overall, the impact of Linux versus Windows on the ending memory state depends on the specific use case and hardware configuration. In general, Linux systems are more efficient and stable when it comes to memory management. However, there may be situations where Windows performs better, and it's important to consider the specific requirements of the application and hardware before making a choice between the two operating systems.
