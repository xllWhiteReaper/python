# File Management Project

This project was developed as part of a university project to expand knowledge of operating systems by simulating the allocation of a file to memory (RAM) using vanilla Python 3.11 and type hints. The project also had a strong focus on Object Oriented Programming and utilized custom and complex data structures.

The project includes several utilities to aid with task distribution and debugging. Additionally, the program is built with the ability to easily add more files(.csv files), to simulate various scenarios and ensure that the program functions correctly.

To test new scenarios, users must add files to the "data" folder, provide paths in the `file_management` class, and define actions in the menu class.

## Main Features

- Simulate allocation of a file to memory (RAM)
